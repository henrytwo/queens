<!--
Rules:
- exactly one piece in each row
- exactly one piece in each col
- exactly one piece in each color region
- colored cells must be connected to each other
- pieces cannot be adjacent to each other (side by side or diagonal)

Pressing a cell once will mark it X to show it's eliminated, and pressing it once again will attempt to place a piece.

You must also verify that the generated board satisfies the parameters specified by the user, and if it is not possible show an alert explaining why.

If a piece is placed down, mark any cells that should be eliminated with an X, but these must be removed if that piece is removed. Do not remove
manually placed pieces.

Great, now I want these UI changes:
1. do not initially show the solutions. Add a toggle that says "show solution" that will reveal the crowns
2. If a user clicks on a cell, mark it with an "X" to allow the user to mentally elminate a cell. If they click on the same cell again, they are attempting to place a crown there.
3. Placing down a crown must comply with these rules:
- exactly one piece in each row
- exactly one piece in each col
- exactly one piece in each color region
- colored cells must be connected to each other
- pieces cannot be adjacent to each other (side by side or diagonal)
4. If it is in violation, you should display the crown in red
5. when a crown is placed down, mark any cells that are eliminated as a result of these rules with an X. If the user removes that crown, any automatically placed X must be removed

When the page loads, allow the user to select size of the board in a dropdown from 1-20, and a start button. Start a timer when the user hits start and display it. If the user finds a solution satisfying the rules, stop the timer and freeze the board

<!--
Rules:
- exactly one piece in each row
- exactly one piece in each col
- exactly one piece in each color region
- colored cells must be connected to each other
- pieces cannot be adjacent to each other (side by side or diagonal)

Pressing a cell once will mark it X to show it's eliminated, and pressing it once again will attempt to place a piece.

You must also verify that the generated board satisfies the parameters specified by the user, and if it is not possible show an alert explaining why.

If a piece is placed down, mark any cells that should be eliminated with an X, but these must be removed if that piece is removed. Do not remove
manually placed pieces.
